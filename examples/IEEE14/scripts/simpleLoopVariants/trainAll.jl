# prepare the data for multiple experiments


# 1. some UNAMBIGOUS dataset and train all methods for performance

# 2. some AMBIGOUS dataset and train all methods for performance

# 3. compare training time between all methods when using fully unsupervised training and fully supervised training

# 4. ideas and testing to improve model performance (lr decay, regularization, prelu, dropout, batch norm)
